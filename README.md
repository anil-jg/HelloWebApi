# HelloWebApi

This project is a sample application that defines a single controller for a Mono project. I created it following the instructions at https://stackoverflow.com/a/36710979/492336.

To be honest, I think that if you create a new WebApi project with Visual Studio, and then open it in Mono, it should open and compile fine, although I haven't tried that.
